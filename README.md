# unit-4-game

Getting Started
RPG Game Instructions:
-After page loads, player starts game by selecting a character by clicking on the character's picture. Characters not selected become the enemies.
-Player must defeat all of the enemies by selecting a defender from the remaining enemies.
-Once the defender is selected, the player clicks the attack button to initiate the fight. With each attack, the defender takes damage from the attacker's attack power and the attacker takes damage from the defender's counter attack power. Health points will be reduced as the fight continues until either the attacker or defender's health points are <= 0.
-Once the defender is defeated, then player selects another defender from the remaining enemies.
-Player wins by defeating all enemies and having health points >= 0. If all enemies are defeated but attacker's health points are <= 0, then the player loses the game.
-Each character in the game has 3 attributes: health points, attack power and Counter Attack Power. Attributes are randomly generated at the start of the game and each attribute must be different. Each time the player attacks the defender, the attacker's attack power increases by its base attack power. The base attack power is the attacker's starting attack power. The defender's counter attack power does not change. Character's health points do not heal or recover.
